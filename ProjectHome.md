Teacher-Aide will provide student attendance and grade management for all types of teachers, homeschoolers and traditional educators alike.

Teachers will add students, set up terms, course information, and assignments. As the students complete assignments the scores can be entered and Teacher-Aide will calculate the grades based on the assignment and rubric configurations.
